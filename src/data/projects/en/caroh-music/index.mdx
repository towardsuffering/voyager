## Project Overview

My musical journey began in high school choir, where an encouraging teacher helped me find my voice after being unaccepted from the baseball team. Though I purchased a guitar afterwards, it sat largely untouched for nearly a decade, with my musical expression limited to occasional karaoke nights. It wasn't until the isolation of COVID-19 that I rediscovered my passion for music, finally dedicating time to learning guitar. Five years into this renewed journey, I've expanded into formal guitar lessons while discovering a passion for keyboard and digital music production. This evolution has led me to create my own home recording setup, where I can bring musical ideas to life.

## Technical Implementation

My home studio setup combines traditional instruments with modern recording technology. Using Pro Tools as my primary Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), I integrate Loopcloud for sample management and creative sound design. This setup allows me to blend live instrumental recordings with digital elements, creating a versatile production environment for both original compositions and covers.
