## Project Overview

Explore a curated selection of Tableau dashboards designed to solve real-world business challenges across various domains, including HR analytics, employee attrition, sales performance, and stock management. These dashboards highlight my proficiency in leveraging Tableau's advanced features, such as calculated fields, parameters, and interactive design principles.

**Please note**: Due to Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) with clients, this portfolio represents only a fraction of my work. The showcased projects demonstrate my ability to deliver impactful, data-driven solutions while adhering to strict confidentiality requirements.

## Technical Implementation

Each dashboard is meticulously crafted using Tableau's robust suite of tools, emphasizing:

- **Advanced Analytics**: Utilization of calculated fields, LOD expressions, and parameters to derive actionable insights.
- **User-Centric Design**: Intuitive and interactive dashboards tailored to end-user needs, ensuring seamless navigation and usability.
- **Data Integration**: Connecting to diverse data sources (e.g., SQL databases, Excel, APIs) to provide real-time, accurate visualizations.
- **Scalability**: Designing dashboards that can handle large datasets and adapt to evolving business requirements.
